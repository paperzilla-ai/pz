## Browse your feed

Use a project ID from the list above:

```bash
pz feed a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890
```

```
Machine Learning Papers — 12 papers (total: 142)

★ Must Read  A Novel Approach to Transformer Efficiency
  Smith et al. · arxiv · 2025-08-01 · relevance: 92%

○ Related  On the Convergence Properties of Diffusion Models
  Chen et al. · arxiv · 2025-07-30 · relevance: 74%
```

## Filter and export

Show only must-read papers:

```bash
pz feed <project-id> --must-read
```

Limit results and filter by date:

```bash
pz feed <project-id> --limit 5 --since 2025-08-01
```

Export as JSON for scripting:

```bash
pz feed <project-id> --json
```

## Configuration

The CLI connects to `https://paperzilla.ai` by default. To use a different API (e.g. for local development), set the `PZ_API_URL` environment variable:

```bash
export PZ_API_URL=http://localhost:8001
```
