ID                                    NAME                       MODE        VISIBILITY  CREATED

```

## Browse your feed

Use a project ID from the list above:

```bash
pz feed a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890
```

```
Machine Learning Papers — 12 papers (total: 142)

★ Must Read  A Novel Approach to Transformer Efficiency
  Smith et al. · arxiv · 2025-08-01 · relevance: 92%

○ Related  On the Convergence Properties of Diffusion Models
  Chen et al. · arxiv · 2025-07-30 · relevance: 74%
```

## Filter and export

Show only must-read papers:

```bash
pz feed <project-id> --must-read
```

Limit results and filter by date:

```bash
pz feed <project-id> --limit 5 --since 2025-08-01
```

Export as JSON for scripting:

```bash
pz feed <project-id> --json
```

## Subscribe in a feed reader

Get an Atom feed URL you can add to [Vienna RSS](https://github.com/ViennaRSS/vienna-rss), NetNewsWire, Feedly, or any other feed reader:

```bash
pz feed <project-id> --atom
```

```
https://paperzilla.ai/api/feed/atom/a1b2c3d4-...?token=pzft_...
```

Paste the URL into your feed reader to subscribe. No login is needed on the reader side — the URL contains a personal feed token. The same URL is returned each time you run the command.

## Configuration

The CLI connects to `https://paperzilla.ai` by default. To use a different API (e.g. for local development), set the `PZ_API_URL` environment variable:

```bash
export PZ_API_URL=http://localhost:8001
```
