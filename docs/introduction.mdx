# Paperzilla CLI

Paperzilla CLI (`pz`) is a command-line tool for [Paperzilla](https://paperzilla.ai), an AI-powered scientific paper discovery platform. It lets you browse your curated research feed, manage projects, and stay on top of new papers — all from the terminal.

## What is Paperzilla?

Paperzilla monitors scientific paper sources (arXiv, bioRxiv, medRxiv, and more) and uses AI to match new publications to your research interests. Each paper gets a relevance score and a personalized note explaining why it matters to you. Papers are classified as either **Must Read** or **Related** based on how closely they match your interests.

You organize your interests into **projects**. Each project has its own feed of matched papers, delivered as email digests or accessible through the web app and this CLI.

## Why a CLI?

- Quickly scan your feed without leaving the terminal
- Pipe JSON output into scripts and other tools
- Integrate paper discovery into your existing workflow
- Works great over SSH on remote machines

## What you can do

- **Log in** with your Paperzilla account using email OTP
- **List projects** to see all your research interests
- **View project details** including matching configuration
- **Browse your feed** with filters for must-read papers, date ranges, and limits
- **Export as JSON** for scripting and automation
